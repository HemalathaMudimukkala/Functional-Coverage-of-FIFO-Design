# Functional-Coverage-of-FIFO-Design
This project involves designing and verifying a FIFO (First-In-First-Out). The FIFO module supports write (wr) and read (rd) operations with an 8-bit data bus (din and dout). It includes internal pointers for tracking read and write operations, and flags for indicating full and empty states.

The testbench employs a structured approach to validate the FIFO design, using tasks to simulate write and read operations. Functional coverage is achieved with a detailed coverage group that monitors various states and transitions, including reset conditions, write and read operations, and the status of FIFO flags (full and empty). The testbench ensures comprehensive verification by applying a range of input values and tracking coverage metrics for different scenarios.

This project demonstrates proficiency in designing and verifying digital components, with a focus on thorough functional coverage to ensure robust and reliable FIFO operation.
